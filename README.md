## Tasks

### 0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

**Instructions:**

-   **Review** the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend.
-   **Create** a detailed document using Draw.io that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support, including:
    -   User Authentication
    -   Property Management
    -   Booking System
    -   Payments
-   **Export** your design as a **PNG file**.
-   **Store** it in a directory called `features-and-functionalities/` within the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **Directory:** `features-and-functionalities/`
-   **File:** `README.md`

### 1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

**Instructions:**

-   **Based** on the features outlined in Task 0, use Draw.io to create a **use case diagram** that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.
-   **Ensure** that all key actors and interactions are captured in the diagram.
-   **Export** your diagram as a **PNG file**.
-   **Store** it in a directory called `use-case-diagram/` within the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **Directory:** `use-case-diagram/`
-   **File:** `README.md`

### 2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

**Objective:** Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**

-   **Using** the use case diagram from Task 1, **convert** each use case into a relevant **user story**. For example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”
-   **Write** at least **5 user stories** that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.
-   **Create** a file named `user-stories.md` in the directory `user-stories/` within the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` and **document** your user stories there.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **Directory:** `user-stories/`
-   **Files:** `user-stories.md`, `README.md`

### 3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

**Instructions:**

-   **Based** on the features and functionalities identified in Task 0, **design** a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system.
-   **Include** key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
-   The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.
-   **Export** your diagram as a PNG file named `data-flow.png`.
-   **Store** it in a directory called `data-flow-diagram/` within the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **Directory:** `data-flow-diagram/`

### 4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes

**Objective:** Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

**Instructions:**

-   **Choose** one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking).
-   **Design** a **flowchart** in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.
-   **Export** the flowchart as a PNG file named `process-flowchart.png`.
-   **Store** it in the `flowcharts/` directory under the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **Directory:** `flowcharts/`
-   **File:** `process-flowchart.png`

### 5. Write Requirement Specifications for Backend Features

**Objective:** Document the technical and functional requirements for each feature.

**Instructions:**

-   **Write** detailed requirement specifications for at least **three key backend features** from Task 0 (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System).
-   **Include**:
    -   API endpoints
    -   Input/output specifications
    -   Validation rules
    -   Performance criteria
-   **Document** this in a `requirements.md` file.
-   **Store** it in the root directory of the GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
-   **Commit** and **push** the changes to your repository.

**Repo:**

-   **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
-   **File:** `requirements.md`
