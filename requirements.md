## Objective

**Learners will identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.**

----------

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing the backend of an Airbnb Clone application. The backend is responsible for handling server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power the web application. The requirements are divided into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is needed to build a fully functional, user-friendly, and efficient system.

----------

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

#### User Registration

-   Allow users to sign up as **guests** or **hosts**.
-   Implement secure authentication methods, such as **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

#### User Login and Authentication

-   Enable login via **email and password**.
-   Include **OAuth options** (e.g., Google, Facebook).

#### Profile Management

-   Allow users to update their profiles, including:
    -   Profile photos
    -   Contact information
    -   Personal preferences

----------

### 2. Property Listings Management

#### Add Listings

-   Enable hosts to create property listings by providing:
    -   Title
    -   Description
    -   Location
    -   Price
    -   Amenities
    -   Availability dates

#### Edit/Delete Listings

-   Allow hosts to update or remove their property listings as needed.

----------

### 3. Search and Filtering

-   Implement a robust search functionality to allow users to find properties based on:
    -   **Location**
    -   **Price range**
    -   **Number of guests**
    -   **Amenities** (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
-   Include **pagination** to handle large datasets efficiently.

----------

### 4. Booking Management

#### Booking Creation

-   Allow guests to book properties for specified dates.
-   Implement **date validation** to prevent double bookings.

#### Booking Cancellation

-   Enable guests or hosts to cancel bookings according to the cancellation policy.

#### Booking Status

-   Track booking statuses, such as:
    -   Pending
    -   Confirmed
    -   Canceled
    -   Completed

----------

### 5. Payment Integration

-   Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**) to handle:
    -   Upfront payments from guests.
    -   Automatic payouts to hosts after booking completion.
-   Support for **multiple currencies**.

----------

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

-   Allow guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in.
-   Enable hosts to respond to reviews.
-   Ensure that reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent misuse.

----------

### 7. Notifications System

-   Implement **email** and **in-app notifications** for:
    -   Booking confirmations
    -   Cancellations
    -   Payment updates
-   Use external services for email notifications (e.g., **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**).

----------

### 8. Admin Dashboard

-   Provide an administrative interface to monitor and manage:
    -   Users (guests and hosts)
    -   Property listings
    -   Bookings
    -   Payments

----------

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

-   Use a **relational database** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**).
-   Required tables/entities:
    -   **Users** (guests and hosts)
    -   **Properties**
    -   **Bookings**
    -   **Reviews**
    -   **Payments**

----------

### 2. API Development

-   Develop **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
-   Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes:
    -   **GET** for retrieving data
    -   **POST** for creating data
    -   **PUT/PATCH** for updating data
    -   **DELETE** for removing data
-   Optionally, implement **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios.

----------

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

-   Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user sessions.
-   Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to differentiate permissions among:
    -   **Guests**
    -   **Hosts**
    -   **Admins**

----------

### 4. File Storage

-   Store property images and user profile photos using a file storage system.
-   Use services like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary** for cloud storage (Note: For implementation purposes, file storage will be used).

----------

### 5. Third-Party Services

-   Integrate with external services:
    -   **Payment Gateways** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
    -   **Email Services** (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun)
    -   **File Storage Services**
    -   **Maps API** for location services (optional)

----------

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

-   Implement global error handling mechanisms for APIs.
-   Provide meaningful error messages to the frontend.
-   Log errors and system events for monitoring and debugging purposes.

----------

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

-   Design a **modular architecture** to facilitate easy scaling as traffic increases.
-   Enable **horizontal scaling** by using load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.

----------

### 2. Security

-   **Encrypt sensitive data**, such as passwords and payment information, both in transit and at rest.
-   Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to protect against malicious activities like DDoS attacks.
-   Regularly update dependencies and patches to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

----------

### 3. Performance Optimization

-   Use **caching mechanisms** (e.g., **Redis**) to improve response times for frequently accessed data.
-   Optimize database queries to reduce server load and improve efficiency.
-   Implement **pagination** and **lazy loading** where appropriate.

----------

### 4. Testing

-   Implement **unit tests** and **integration tests** using frameworks like **PyTest** or equivalent.
-   Include **automated API testing** to ensure all endpoints function as expected.
-   Use continuous integration tools to run tests automatically on code changes.

----------

**Note:** Adhering to these requirements will help in building a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Airbnb Clone backend system that meets both functional and technical expectations.
