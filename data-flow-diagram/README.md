
# Data Flow Diagram for Airbnb Clone Backend

## Objective

Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

## Task Description

Based on the features and functionalities identified, we have designed a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io (diagrams.net) that illustrates how data moves through the Airbnb Clone backend system. The diagram includes key entities such as users, properties, bookings, and payments.

The DFD covers data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations, providing a visual representation of how data is processed, stored, and communicated within the system.

## Diagram Details

-   **File Name**: `data-flow.png`
-   **Location**: `data-flow-diagram/` directory within this repository.



## Diagram Overview

The Data Flow Diagram represents the following components:

### External Entities

-   **Guests**
-   **Hosts**
-   **Admins**
-   **Payment Gateway** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
-   **Email Service** (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun)
-   **File Storage Service** (for storing images)

### Processes

1.  **User Management**
    
    -   User Registration
    -   User Login and Authentication
    -   Profile Management
2.  **Property Listings Management**
    
    -   Add Listings
    -   Edit/Delete Listings
3.  **Search and Filtering**
    
    -   Search Properties
    -   Apply Filters
4.  **Booking Management**
    
    -   Booking Creation
    -   Booking Cancellation
    -   Booking Status Update
5.  **Payment Integration**
    
    -   Process Payment
    -   Issue Refund
6.  **Reviews and Ratings**
    
    -   Submit Review
    -   Host Response
7.  **Notifications System**
    
    -   Send Email Notification
    -   Send In-App Notification
8.  **Admin Dashboard**
    
    -   Manage Users
    -   Manage Listings
    -   Manage Bookings
    -   Manage Payments

### Data Stores

-   **Users Database** (D1)
-   **Properties Database** (D2)
-   **Bookings Database** (D3)
-   **Payments Database** (D4)
-   **Reviews Database** (D5)

### Data Flows

The diagram illustrates how data flows between external entities, processes, and data stores:

-   **Data Inputs**: Information provided by users (e.g., registration data, booking details).
-   **Processes**: Operations that transform data (e.g., processing payments, managing bookings).
-   **Data Outputs**: Results of processes communicated back to users or external services (e.g., confirmations, notifications).

## Steps Taken to Create the Diagram

1.  **Identified External Entities**: Recognized all external actors interacting with the system.
2.  **Defined Processes**: Mapped out the core backend operations required for the system.
3.  **Established Data Stores**: Determined where data would be stored within the system.
4.  **Mapped Data Flows**: Illustrated how data moves between entities, processes, and data stores.
5.  **Designed the Diagram**: Used Draw.io to visually represent all components and their interactions.
6.  **Exported the Diagram**: Saved the diagram as `data-flow.png`.
7.  **Organized Files**: Placed the diagram in the `data-flow-diagram/` directory.
8.  **Committed Changes**: Added the diagram to the repository with an appropriate commit message.
